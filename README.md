# Github Releases Summary

Webpage to generate a summary for a github repository's releases with the total number of downloads and some info about the latest release and the latest stable release, among other things.

For now, it's quite basic visually and content-wise, but I'll try to make it more appealing and add some more data about the releases in the future.
